# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction  

## 📖 Project Description  
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML) regression models** to predict bike-sharing demand based on historical data. The goal is to help optimize bike rental services by forecasting demand based on various factors like weather, time, and holiday status.

## 🛠 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bike-sharing-demand-prediction.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd bike-sharing-demand-prediction
   ```  
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
5. Run the `Regression_Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction_ML.ipynb` file.  

## 🚀 Usage  
- Load the dataset and perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature engineering, scaling).  
- Train **Regression Models** to predict bike demand.  
- Evaluate the model’s performance.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- The dataset includes:  
  - **Datetime** (timestamp of bike rentals)  
  - **Temperature, Humidity, and Wind speed**  
  - **Season and Weather condition**  
  - **Holiday and Working day information**  
  - **Bike rental count (target variable)**  
- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle/Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data).  

## ✨ Features  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Feature Engineering**  
- **Regression Modeling**  
- **Model Evaluation (RMSE, R² Score, MAE)**  
- **Data Visualization**  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Machine Learning Models** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

## 📈 Results  
- The project successfully predicts bike demand with **high accuracy** using optimized regression models.  
- The model helps **identify demand trends** based on weather, time, and seasonality.  
- Insights can be used by **bike-sharing services** to optimize fleet distribution.
